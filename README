An old Perl script used to find and filter real estate deals from ss.lv and zip.lv.
User is notified of matching results with a system tray notification.

The idea was later pushed on in Garage48 Riga hackathon as a project named "Cribok".
It had Android application that received latest matches through push notifications.
Server side was modular. Data could be scraped from multiple sites and sent from
multiple servers to the central server parsing, storing and doing all kinds of 
magic with the data. Main server was written in RoR.

The prototype was (and probably still is) working but I have no clue where the 
server side code is right now. (I still have the Android application).
If you are interested in this, write me, I could search for it and post it online.

Still, this script still works and can be used.
Check files to see what perl modules are needed.
It probably should be updated not to use Curl and other modules but since we 
worked on the Cribok project, it would make more sense finishing that one.

Anyway, feel free to use this and remember it was made on Linux for Linux so don't
be supprised if it doesn't work on Windows. :)
